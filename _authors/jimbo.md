My name's Antonio Ramos, I'm a Puerto Rican from Houston, Texas who graduated in the top one percent of my class as Summa Cum Laude from Clear Springs High School in the Spring of 2021. Currently, I'm a senior pursuing a major in computer science and a minor in Spanish at the University of Texas at Austin. Moreover, I'm actively working with the Austin non-profit [Senior Access](https://senioraccesstx.org/) as a website and database engineer.

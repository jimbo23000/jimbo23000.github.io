Here's a cool photo of me.<br>

### A little bit about me...

Well it just so happens that my name's **Jimbo**. I like food.<br>
I'm fairly experienced in the Java programming language. Just started learning C#.<br>
I have a lot of interesting projects planned for the future, so stay tuned.

### Projects to come...

- [ ] Pokemon Tamagotchi Desktop App
- [ ] Untitled RPG
- [ ] Untitled Dungeon Crawler

### Everything here is subject to change.

I'm still learning how to utilize the full potential of GitHub and Markdown, so expect things to be constantly changing.

  A Little Bit About Me...
</h1>

>My name's Antonio Ramos, I'm a Puerto Rican from Houston, Texas and I graduated in the top one percent of my class as Summa Cum Laude from Clear Springs High School in the Spring of 2021. Currently, I'm a junior pursuing a major in computer science and a minor in Spanish at the University of Texas at Austin. Moreover, I'm actively working with the Austin non-profit [Senior Access](https://senioraccesstx.org/) as a website and database engineer.

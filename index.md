Here's a cool photo of me.<br>

### A little bit about me...

I have been programming since I was a sophomore in high school.<br>
I'm experienced in the Java programming language and have a bit of experience working in C#.<br>
I have a lot of interesting projects planned for the future, so stay tuned.

### Projects to come...

- [ ] Block Chain
- [ ] Untitled RPG
- [ ] Untitled Dungeon Crawler

### This website is subject to change.

I'm still learning how to utilize the full potential of GitHub and Markdow, so I'll be updating the website as I learn more.

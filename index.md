### A little bit about me...

I have been programming since I was a sophomore in high school. At the moment I'm a freshman in college.<br>
I learned the fundementals of programming in Java and work in multiple languages now.<br>
I have a lot of interesting projects planned for the future, so check back in from time to time.

### Projects to come...

- [ ] [Blockchain](https://github.com/jimbo23000/Blockchain)
- [ ] Untitled RPG
- [ ] Untitled OS

### This website is subject to change.

I'm still learning how to utilize the full potential of GitHub and Markdown, so I'll be updating the website as I learn more.

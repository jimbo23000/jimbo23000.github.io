* *What did you think of Paper 12. Why extends is evil and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 12, Why extends is evil, made a really strong case against implementation inheritance. It clearly showed how using extends can lead to fragile, tightly coupled code that is harder to change and debug. The examples, especially the ones involving the Stack and Monitorable-Stack, highlighted how small changes in a base class can unexpectedly break derived classes. What I found most convincing was how the paper tied these issues to Agile development principles, where flexibility and quick changes are important. It made me realize that just because inheritance is available, it does not mean it is the right choice. To improve the paper, I think it could include more guidance on when, if ever, it is appropriate to use extends, or provide real-world examples of good inheritance versus interface-based design. Overall, it is a great reminder that we should be intentional with our code structure and prioritize flexibility, which is much easier to achieve using interfaces.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #12: Singleton, Exercise #13: Observer or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * I was absent for Exercise #12 on the Singleton pattern, so I didnâ€™t get the chance to work on it or help anyone else with it. For Exercise #13 on the Observer pattern, I worked with two other students, and we found it pretty straightforward. We discussed the structure briefly, especially how the Observer interface makes it easy to extend functionality without modifying the existing code, and finished it quickly without any major issues.

* *What did you think of the following topics, Shapes, virtual function table, override, abstract methods, and abstract classes, and what would make them better?*

    * I thought the topics of Shapes, virtual function tables, override, abstract methods, and abstract classes were really interesting and helped deepen my understanding of how inheritance works in Java. The Shape and Circle examples were helpful for seeing how method overriding and dynamic binding work in practice. I especially liked the explanation of virtual function tables, which made it clear how the correct method is chosen at runtime based on the actual object. Abstract methods and classes showed how we can enforce structure in subclasses without providing full implementations. One thing that would make these topics better is adding a small in-class coding activity where we modify or extend the Shape hierarchy ourselves. That hands-on experience would help reinforce the concepts and give us a chance to catch common mistakes, like forgetting to override a method or misunderstanding method signatures. Overall, I found the material clear and engaging.

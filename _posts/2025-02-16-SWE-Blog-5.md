* *What did you think of Paper 5. The Single Responsibility Principle and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 5 on the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) did a great job of explaining why each class should have only one reason to change. The examples, like the Rectangle class handling both geometry and GUI rendering, really helped me understand how combining multiple responsibilities can make code harder to maintain and more prone to issues. I believe the discussion on test-driven development reinforcing SRP was particularly useful because it showed how good testing practices naturally lead to better design. The paper made me realize how violating SRP can slow down development with unnecessary recompilation and retesting. However, I think it could be improved by providing more practical strategies for refactoring existing code, especially in larger projects. While the examples were helpful, I would have liked to see more real-world applications and step-by-step techniques for applying SRP effectively. Overall, I found the paper insightful and thought it provided a strong foundation for understanding SRP.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #4: range or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * The teaching staff did help me with Exercise #4: range, but they weren’t able to pinpoint why my code was failing the test cases, which made it difficult for me to finish. I understood the general concept, but without knowing exactly what was wrong, I struggled to fix the issue. For the quizzes, I’ve been checking my answers with the guys around me, and that’s been really helpful. Discussing different approaches and comparing answers has given me a better understanding of the material. I think more detailed debugging guidance during exercises would make it easier to troubleshoot and improve my code.

* *What did you think of the following topics: range, types, count(), zip(), yield and what would make them better?*

    * We learned about range, types, count(), zip(), and yield, and I found them all really useful. Range made loops more efficient, and understanding types helped in writing more structured and error-free code. Count() was great for working with lists and strings, while zip() made it easy to pair and combine data from multiple sequences. Yield was a bit tricky at first, but it was interesting to see how it changes the way functions return values. The explanations in class were helpful, but more hands-on exercises and examples would have made these concepts even clearer and easier to apply.

* *What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?*

    * My pick-of-the-week is an article about [Nvidia’s RTX 5090 GPUs experiencing power connector issues](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-rtx-5090-power-cables-may-be-doomed-to-burn), leading to potential hardware failures. I found this interesting because it highlights the challenges of designing high-performance technology and the risks of hardware flaws. I wanted to share it as a reminder of how important reliability and thorough testing are in tech development.

* *What did you think of Paper 11. More on getters and setters and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 11, More on Getters and Setters, offered a strong critique of the common use of accessor methods in object-oriented programming. It argues that getters and setters can undermine encapsulation by exposing internal details, making code harder to maintain and refactor. Instead, it promotes having objects manage their own behavior, preserving encapsulation and reducing fragility. The discussion of the Builder pattern was especially helpful in showing how separating construction from representation can lead to cleaner, more modular code. I found this perspective insightful because it challenged practices I had previously considered standard. It also made me think more carefully about how small design decisions can ripple through a codebase. However, the paper would benefit from acknowledging cases where accessors are practical—like in frameworks or with data transfer objects—without significantly breaking encapsulation. Including that context would offer a more balanced view. Since the paper is over two decades old, an updated perspective reflecting modern languages and development practices would also improve its relevance. Overall, it presents valuable insights, and with a few updates, could be an even more useful read.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #11: SQL Join or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * Yes, I helped a few students around me during Exercise #11 by talking through different join strategies and checking our results together. Collaborating made it easier to troubleshoot and refine our queries since we could quickly compare approaches and spot issues. It was a really insightful experience that helped reinforce my own understanding while also making the process more efficient for everyone involved.

* *What did you think of the following topics, SQL, set union, set intersection, set difference, left join, right join, Java, final classes, and static methods, and what would make them better?*

    * I found the topics we covered, especially SQL operations like set union, intersection, difference, and joins, really engaging because they helped me better understand how to manipulate and query relational data effectively. It was interesting to see how similar results could be achieved using different approaches, like subqueries versus joins. I also appreciated exploring the behavior of left and right joins, particularly in scenarios where data isn’t guaranteed to match across tables. Shifting gears to Java, learning about final classes and static methods felt like a good refresher on how to enforce design constraints and shared behaviors. What would make these topics even better is more hands-on practice with real-world datasets to see how these concepts scale in practical applications.

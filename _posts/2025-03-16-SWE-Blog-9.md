* *What did you think of Paper 9, The Dependency Inversion Principle, and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 9, The Dependency Inversion Principle, was a well-structured and insightful discussion on one of the core SOLID principles in object-oriented design. I really liked how the paper gradually introduced the concept, starting with the problems of traditional hierarchical dependencies and then showing how dependency inversion improves flexibility and maintainability. The step-by-step approach, with diagrams and C++ code examples, made it easier for me to understand how to transition from a rigid, tightly coupled design to a more abstracted, decoupled one. I also appreciated the real-world examples, like the Button and Lamp analogy, which helped clarify the practical applications of the principle. However, I think the paper could be improved by making some of the explanations a little more accessible, especially for readers who might not have a strong background in C++ or software architecture. A clearer summary at the end would have reinforced the key takeaways, and I would have liked to see more direct comparisons between dependency inversion and the other SOLID principles to understand how they all fit together. Overall, I found the paper very informative and engaging, and it gave me a much better understanding of why dependency inversion is so important in software design.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #7: project, Exercise #8: cross join, Exercise #9: natural join, or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * I worked with those around me on all three exercises, project, cross join, and natural join, by discussing how to approach each problem and then coding our solutions. The hardest part was being introduced to a new concept and then immediately having to implement it without much guidance. This was especially true for natural join, where understanding how to match keys correctly was tricky at first. We helped each other break down the problem, figure out what the function and class needed to do, and worked through any confusion together. Collaborating made it much easier to grasp the concepts and complete the exercises.

* *What did you think of the following topics, relational algebra, project, cross join, theta join, and natural join, and what would make them better?*

    * I found relational algebra and its operations like project, cross join, theta join, and natural join interesting but challenging. As I mentioned prior, the hardest part was being introduced to each concept and then immediately applying it in code. Project and cross join were straightforward, but theta join and natural join required more thought. More guided examples before jumping into implementation would have helped. Overall, working through these exercises with others made understanding the topics much easier.

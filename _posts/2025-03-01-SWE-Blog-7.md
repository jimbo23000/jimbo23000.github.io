* *What did you think of Paper 7. The Liskov Substitution Principle and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 7 presented the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) as a crucial concept in object-oriented design, emphasizing that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the program’s correctness. The paper effectively explains this principle, particularly through the Rectangle-Square example, which I found compelling because it demonstrates how a seemingly logical inheritance relationship can lead to issues when a subclass changes the expected behavior of a superclass. Since a square must always have equal width and height, modifying one dimension affects the other, violating LSP and potentially causing unexpected behavior in a program. I believe the paper does a great job of illustrating the problem, but it could be improved by offering more practical solutions for adhering to LSP. For instance, discussing design alternatives like composition over inheritance would help readers understand how to structure their code more effectively. Additionally, I think incorporating real-world case studies showing the consequences of LSP violations would make the concept even more impactful and applicable to software development.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #5: cache or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * Yes, I received help from another student on Exercise #5: cache. I understood how to use a dictionary for caching but wasn’t sure how to apply it within a decorator function and class. The student helped me structure the decorator function to wrap the Fibonacci function and store results. They also explained how to transition the logic into a decorator class. Overall, their guidance helped me better understand how to implement caching with decorators.

* *What did you think of the following topics, and what would make them better? =, \*, and \*\* in functions, regular expressions with instance methods, static methods, and class methods.*

    * I thought these topics were interesting and useful, especially in understanding different function types and their behaviors in Python. The use of =, \*, and \*\* in functions helped clarify how to assign, unpack, and pass arguments dynamically, which is particularly useful for writing flexible functions. Regular expressions with instance methods were a bit tricky at first, but the examples made it clearer how re.split() and re.search() behave with different patterns. Static methods and class methods were also insightful, especially in understanding when to use @staticmethod versus @classmethod. I found it helpful to see how class methods operate on the class level, while static methods function independently. To improve comprehension, incorporating more real-world examples would help clarify these concepts and demonstrate their practical applications.

* *What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?*

    * My pick-of-the-week is an article about [ChatGPT 4.5](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-45/), which highlights OpenAI’s latest and most advanced AI model. While GPT-4.5 boasts enhanced capabilities, its development and operational costs are significantly higher than previous models. For instance, GPT-4.5 is priced at $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens, compared to GPT-4’s $2.50 and $10, respectively.  This substantial increase raises concerns about the sustainability of continually scaling AI models. I’m curious about when these models might become too large and costly to develop, potentially hindering accessibility and further innovation in the field.

* *What did you think of Paper 6. The Open-Closed Principle and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 6 on the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) was really helpful. The main idea—that code should be easy to extend without changing existing parts, makes a lot of sense for keeping software flexible and maintainable. The paper explains this well with examples, like the shape-drawing scenario, showing how OCP prevents breaking code when adding new features. However, I think it could be better by discussing some downsides, like how following OCP too strictly might make code more complicated than necessary. It would also help to include examples from different programming styles to make it clearer for more people. Another good addition would be tips on how to balance OCP with other principles, like the Single Responsibility Principle, so developers can apply it in a practical way. Overall, the paper gives a solid introduction to OCP, and with a few improvements, it could be even more useful for writing maintainable and flexible code.

* *Did you get help or give help on the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * I both got and gave help on the quizzes, mainly through discussions in the Zoom breakout rooms. We would go over difficult questions together, share our reasoning, and clarify any confusing parts. Talking through the problems with others helped me understand tricky concepts better, and explaining my own thought process to someone else reinforced my learning. It was really useful to hear different perspectives, as sometimes another student would approach a question in a way I hadn’t thought of. The breakout rooms created a supportive space where we could work through challenges as a group, making the quizzes feel less stressful. Overall, this experience was extremely beneficial, as it not only improved my understanding but also built confidence in my problem-solving skills.

* *What did you think of the following topics: comprehensions, callables, functions, decorators, and what would make them better?*

    * I found comprehensions, callables, functions, and decorators in Python to be really useful, especially for writing cleaner and more efficient code. List comprehensions make looping and filtering much more concise, and callables help create more flexible and reusable functions. Functions, in general, are the backbone of structuring code well, and decorators are great for adding functionality without modifying existing code. However, decorators were a bit tricky at first since the syntax and concept of wrapping functions can be confusing. It would be helpful to have more real-world examples and hands-on exercises to practice using them in different scenarios. Overall, these topics are powerful tools in Python, and with more examples and guided practice, they could be even easier to grasp.

* *What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?*

    * My pick-of-the-week is Microsoft’s announcement of [Majorana 1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-the-worlds-first-quantum-processor-powered-by-topological-qubits/), the world’s first quantum processor powered by topological qubits. This breakthrough introduces topoconductors, a new class of materials that enable more stable and scalable qubits, bringing us closer to fault-tolerant quantum computing. I found this especially interesting for our field because it has the potential to revolutionize problem-solving in areas like cryptography, simulations, and AI, pushing computing beyond classical limits.

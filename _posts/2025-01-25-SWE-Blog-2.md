* *Did you help your classmates with either the quizzes or the exercises? If so, how?*

    * I helped the guy next to me with the in-class exercise on Friday. I showed him how to get to ED Lessons and pointed out which test cases needed fixing, along with a few key spots in the code that needed adjustments.

* *What did you think of Paper #2: Makefile and what would make it better?*

    * I thought reviewing the Makefile for the first project was a great refresher and a chance to revisit the inner workings of Makefiles. Having worked with them extensively last semester, it was a helpful reminder of how dependencies, targets, and rules all come together to streamline the build process. It also reinforced how powerful and efficient Makefiles are for managing even complex builds in a straightforward and organized way.

* *What did you think of the assertions, unit tests, coverage, exceptions, and what would make it better?*

    * I believe assertions, unit tests, coverage, and exceptions are fundamental to building reliable and maintainable software. In my experience, assertions are valuable for validating assumptions during development, as they provide immediate feedback when conditions aren’t met. However, I think it’s important to use them carefully to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to the code. Unit tests, in my view, play a crucial role in verifying the functionality of individual components and act as a safeguard against unintended changes. Writing thorough tests, especially for edge cases, can be challenging but is essential for improving code quality. I find that coverage tools offer helpful insights into how well tests exercise the code. While achieving high coverage is important, I believe it’s even more critical to focus on creating meaningful tests that prioritize functionality and correctness rather than chasing arbitrary coverage metrics. As for exceptions, I think they’re essential for gracefully handling unexpected scenarios, which enhances the robustness of the software. However, I’ve also seen how poorly managed exceptions can complicate logic and make the code harder to read. Overall, I think balancing the use of these tools and techniques is key to creating dependable and maintainable software.

* *What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?*

    * My pick-of-the-week is an article highlighting the [significant environmental dangers posed by cryptocurrency](https://unu.edu/press-release/un-study-reveals-hidden-environmental-impacts-bitcoin-carbon-not-only-harmful-product), particularly Bitcoin mining. The massive energy consumption, primarily reliant on fossil fuels, leads to alarming carbon emissions, water usage, and land degradation. These hidden environmental costs often go unnoticed, and I believe more people need to be aware of this issue to spark meaningful conversations and encourage action to address and regulate these impacts.

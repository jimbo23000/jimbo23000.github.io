* *What did you think of Paper 8. The Integration Segregation Principle and what would make it better?*

    * I thought the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) was really useful because it helps keep code clean and flexible by avoiding bloated interfaces. The paper does a great job explaining how forcing all clients to depend on methods they don’t need creates unnecessary complexity. I liked the example with the Door and TimedDoor because it clearly shows why adding extra functionality to a general interface can lead to problems. If every Door has to support timing, even when it doesn’t need to, it just creates clutter. That said, I believe the paper could be better if it included more real-world examples. The Door example is helpful, but I would’ve liked to see how ISP applies in other areas, like APIs or large-scale software projects. I also think it would be more practical if it gave clearer steps on how to identify when an interface is too big and how to break it down effectively. Overall, I thought the paper made a strong case for ISP, and I think it’s an important principle, but adding more variety and practical advice would make it even stronger.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #6: select or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * Yes, I did receive help on Exercise #6: select from another student. We worked through the problem together, reasoning our way to a solution for both the function implementation using yield and the class implementation without it. We discussed how the generator version allows for lazy evaluation, while the class-based approach manually iterates and filters elements. Talking through the logic behind ```__next__``` and how the while True loop ensures only valid elements are returned helped clarify things for both of us. Collaborating made the problem easier to understand, and we both walked away with a better grasp of iterators.

* *What did you think of the following topics, relational algebra and select, and what would make them better?*

    * I thought relational algebra was a useful way to understand how data is queried, especially since it follows a structured set of operations like integer arithmetic. The idea that everything is closed under its operations makes it feel logical and consistent. Concepts like select and project were straightforward, especially when thinking about filtering and restructuring tables. For select, I liked seeing different Python implementations, especially the generator versions that allow lazy evaluation. Writing test cases helped me understand how it works in practice. However, I think more real-world examples, like how relational algebra translates to SQL, would make it clearer. Also, it would help to discuss when to use each select implementation based on efficiency and readability. Overall, I found both topics interesting, and adding more practical examples would make them even better.

* *What are you most proud of doing last week?*

    * I'm especially proud of completing Project 4 without using any slip days, something I haven’t managed since the first project. I’m also proud of our solution, as we pushed ourselves to deeply understand and effectively implement interfaces. I also thought the UML diagram we created was well-designed and visually engaging.

* *What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud of?*

    * The primary skill that made this achievement possible was teamwork, closely followed by foresight, as my partner and I started early and dedicated our first two sessions solely to designing our solution.

* *What impact did you have on other people?*

    * On Friday, I got to spend time with my girlfriend’s family from Mexico while they were visiting Austin, which made everyone really happy. I also visited my family in College Station for the A&M football game against New Mexico, which was a lot of fun since both my girlfriend and my brother are Aggies.

* *What did you think of Paper #12. Why extends is evil.*

    * I found this paper about avoiding the use of the extends keyword to closely align with what Professor Downing has been emphasizing in class through both lectures and exercises. It also reminded me of the earlier paper on avoiding the use of getters and setters, which I found to be a valuable challenge for Project 4. Both papers reinforce the importance of designing clean, flexible code that minimizes coupling and adheres to principles like abstraction and encapsulation. Overall, I plan to adopt this design mindset more consciously in my future project designs to create more robust and maintainable solutions.

* *What did you think of Exercise #9. Shapes 1.*

    * I found Exercise 9, which focused on helping us better understand inheritance through the use of the colon syntax for classes in C++, to be a well-designed challenge. It felt appropriately aligned with the level of difficulty exercises in this course should have.

* *What did you think of Exercise #10. Shapes 2.*

    * Additionally, I thought Exercise 10, which focused on understanding the virtual keyword and dynamic casting, was an excellent continuation of the previous exercise. It significantly reinforced my foundational understanding of these concepts and their applications.
    
---
* *What did you think of method overriding, virtual, and dynamic_cast?*

    * As I mentioned earlier, I found method overriding, the virtual keyword, and dynamic casting to be valuable additions to my toolkit. I’m excited to apply these concepts in future projects.

* *What made you happy this week?*

    * Spending time with my family, both extended and immediate, truly made my week and gave me the motivation I needed to push through the rest of the semester, especially with senioritis hitting hard.

* *What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?*

    * My pick-of-the-week is an article about [quantum computing cooling](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-way-quantum-computing-systems-keep-their-cool-0221), a topic I’ve become really interested in recently. It’s fascinating to learn how these systems operate at temperatures among the coldest in the known universe.

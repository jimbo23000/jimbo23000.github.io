* *What are you most proud of doing last week?*

    * I'm genuinely proud of myself for making it through this week, especially since senioritis has been hitting me harder than ever as we get closer to the end of the semester. The struggle to stay motivated and focused has been real, but despite that, I've managed to push through and keep going. It hasn’t been easy balancing everything while fighting the constant urge to procrastinate, but just getting through this week feels like a small victory in itself.

* *What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud of?*

    * This week was challenging, but I leaned heavily on my skill of perseverance to push through and stay on track. There were moments when it felt like giving up would be easier, but I reminded myself of the importance of staying committed to my goals. Perseverance helped me face obstacles head-on, manage my time effectively, and keep moving forward even when motivation was low. It’s a skill I’m proud of, and it made all the difference in getting through the week successfully.

* *What impact did you have on other people?*

    * I’m back home in Houston with my girlfriend’s family and my own, which has made everyone really happy. However, part of the family is currently quarantining because they’re sick with COVID-19. Thankfully, they’re feeling better and should test negative before Thanksgiving, so we’re hopeful we can all celebrate together safely. It’s been a mix of joy and caution, but we’re making the best of it.

* *What did you think of Paper #13. What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You.*

    * I found this paper about discrimination in the computer science field really eye-opening. It highlighted the challenges faced by underrepresented groups, such as bias and inequality, even in an industry that values innovation. The stories and data shared gave me a better understanding of these issues and made me think about ways to create a more inclusive and fair environment in computer science.

* *What did you think of the virtual method overriding and Life?*

    * I found virtual method overriding to be a fascinating concept as it allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior in object-oriented programming, making code more adaptable and reusable. Learning about "Life" was equally intriguing, as it demonstrated how small rules could create complex, evolving patterns, which is a powerful reminder of how simplicity can lead to intricate outcomes.

* *What made you happy this week?*

    * As stated prior, making it through the week and being back home in Houston has made me extremely happy.

---
* *What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?*

    * My tip-of-the-week is to focus on finding a balance between schoolwork—especially any computer science projects you might have—and spending quality time with family.

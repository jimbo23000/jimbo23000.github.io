* *What did you think of Paper 13. Misogyny and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 13, Misogyny, was a really impactful read. Irene Zhang shares her experiences as a woman in computer science, highlighting how success can sometimes bring more harassment instead of recognition. Her analogy comparing moral misalignment in society to issues in distributed systems was especially insightful, showing how deeply rooted these problems are. The article sheds light on how women are often expected to manage men’s emotions, and how their authority is frequently undermined. To make it even better, it would be helpful to include some data or studies to show that these experiences are part of a larger pattern. Also, offering concrete steps for individuals and institutions to address these issues would provide readers with practical ways to foster a more inclusive environment in tech.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #14: Strategy1, Exercise #15: Strategy2, Exercise #16: Factory or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * Yes, I did both get and give help on these exercises. For Exercise #14: Strategy1 and Exercise #16: Factory, I worked closely with the students around me, and honestly, that collaboration really helped deepen my understanding of the material. Talking through the code together made the design patterns click in a way that just reading or coding solo wouldn’t have. I was absent for Exercise #15: Strategy2, so I leaned on my classmates a bit to catch up on what I missed. They helped walk me through the structure and ideas behind using interfaces to improve the flexibility of the code. In turn, I shared insights I’d picked up from working on the other exercises. That back-and-forth was super useful, it wasn’t just about getting the right answers but actually understanding the concepts behind them. Being able to bounce ideas off of each other was honestly one of the most valuable parts of the learning experience.

* *What did you think of the following topics, Strategy design pattern, reflection, Factory Method design pattern, and Abstract Factory design pattern, and what would make them better?*

    * I thought the Strategy, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory design patterns were really useful for learning how to write flexible, modular code. They made it clear how to separate concerns and follow the open-closed principle, which is something I hadn’t fully appreciated before. Reflection was a bit trickier to wrap my head around, but seeing it used in Strategy3 helped me understand how powerful it can be, though it also feels like something to use carefully. To make these topics better, I think more visual examples or diagrams would help, especially for understanding how the pieces fit together across different classes.

* *What did you think of Paper 10. Why getter and setter methods are evil and what would make it better?*

    * I thought Paper 10, Why getter and setter methods are evil, made a strong and thought-provoking case against the overuse of accessors in object-oriented programming. It does a great job of explaining how getter and setter methods break encapsulation by exposing internal implementation details, which can make systems harder to maintain or scale over time. I liked how the author emphasized shifting away from a procedural mindset toward thinking in terms of objects with clearly defined responsibilities that collaborate through messages. The CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaborator) approach and real-world use case examples helped make the argument more practical. That said, I think the paper could be better if it included more accessible examples, especially for readers unfamiliar with Java UI frameworks like AWT or Swing. Some of the technical explanations, like the drawYourself() example, might be hard to follow for beginners. A simpler analogy or a more general use case could help drive the core message home without needing so much background knowledge. Overall, though, itâ€™s a solid read that challenges common practices and encourages more thoughtful design.

* *Did you get help or give help on Exercise #10: SQL Select or the quizzes? If so, how?*

    * I helped a couple of classmates with Exercise #10 by walking them through how the like, in, and between clauses work in SQL. They were stuck on a few of the queries, so I explained the logic behind each condition and showed how to break down what the query was actually asking for. We compared the results together to make sure everything made sense.

* *What did you think of the following topics, SQL, select, cross join, inner join, natural join, subqueries, and update, and what would make them better?*

    * I found the SQL topics like select, join, subquery, and update really useful for understanding how to retrieve and manipulate data in structured ways. Learning the difference between cross join, inner join, and natural join helped clarify how table relationships work and how data can be connected across multiple tables. The use of using versus on also made it easier to write cleaner queries when column names matched. Subqueries were especially helpful for filtering and updating rows based on more complex conditions, like finding students with the highest GPA or colleges with certain characteristics. The update examples, especially those using temporary tables, showed how powerful SQL can be for making changes in bulk. Seeing the resulting tables during lecture really helped solidify how each query transformed the data. One thing that could make it better would be spending a little more time explaining when to use each type of join in real scenarios.

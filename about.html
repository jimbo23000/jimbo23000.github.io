<p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-indent: 5%;">
  My name's Antonio Ramos, I'm a Puerto Rican from Houston, Texas and I graduated in the top one percent of my class as 
  Summa Cum Laude from Clear Springs High School in the Spring of 2021. Currently, I'm a junior pursuing a major in 
  computer science and a minor in Spanish at the University of Texas at Austin. Moreover, I'm actively working with the 
  Austin non-profit <a href="https://senioraccesstx.org/">Senior Access</a> as a website and database engineer.

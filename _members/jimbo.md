My name is Antonio Ramos. I’m a Puerto Rican American from Houston, Texas, and I recently earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin. I have extensive experience working on projects in both small and large team settings, and I’m proficient in most industry-standard programming languages. Additionally, I’ve been actively involved with Texas-based non-profits, including the Austin-based organization [Senior Access](https://senioraccesstx.org/).
